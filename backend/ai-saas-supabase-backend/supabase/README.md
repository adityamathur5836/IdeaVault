# Supabase Backend for AI-Powered SaaS Platform

This README provides instructions for setting up and configuring the Supabase backend for the AI-powered SaaS platform focused on business idea generation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **migrations/**: Contains SQL migration files for setting up the database schema.
- **seed/**: Contains SQL scripts for seeding the database with initial data.
- **edge-functions/**: Contains custom Edge Functions for business logic, including grading, billing webhooks, and notifications.
- **policies/**: Contains row-level security policies to manage data access.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Supabase account
- Supabase CLI installed
- PostgreSQL knowledge

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-saas-supabase-backend/supabase
   ```

2. **Initialize Supabase**
   ```bash
   supabase init
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**
   To create the initial database schema, run:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

4. **Seed the Database**
   To populate the database with initial data, run:
   ```bash
   supabase db seed
   ```

5. **Deploy Edge Functions**
   Deploy the Edge Functions to handle custom business logic:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy

### Edge Functions

- **grading.ts**: Implements the grading algorithm for ideas.
- **billing-webhook.ts**: Handles incoming webhooks from payment providers.
- **notifications.ts**: Sends notifications to users based on events.

### Row-Level Security

Row-level security policies are defined in `policies/rls.sql` to ensure appropriate data access based on user roles.

### API Integration

Refer to the `api-examples/` directory for examples of RESTful and real-time API calls to interact with the backend.

### Frontend Integration

Instructions for connecting the Supabase backend with a React and Tailwind CSS frontend can be found in `frontend-integration/react-tailwind-setup.md`.
